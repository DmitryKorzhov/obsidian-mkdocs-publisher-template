For example, you can link to a file in a vault like so (please note the required encoding ): [ Link to note ]( obsidian://open?path=D:%2Fpath%2Fto%2Ffile.md ) Link to note You can link to a note by its vault name and file name instead of path as well: [ Link to note ]( obsidian://open?vault=MainVault&file=MyNote.md ) Link to note Escaping \u00b6 If there are spaces in the url, they can be escaped by either using %20 as a space, such as: [ Export options ]( Pasted%20image ) Export options Or you can enclose the target in <> , such as: [ Slides Demo ]( <Slides Demo> ) Slides Demo Blockquotes \u00b6 > Human beings face ever more complex and urgent problems, and their effectiveness in dealing with these problems is a matter that is critical to the stability and continued progress of society. \\- Doug Engelbart, 1961 Human beings face ever more complex and urgent problems, and their effectiveness in dealing with these problems is a matter that is critical to the stability and continued progress of society. - Doug Engelbart, 1961 Inline code \u00b6 Text inside `backticks` on a line will be formatted like code.

We use prismjs for syntax highlighting, a list of supported languages can be found at their site ```js function fancyAlert(arg) { if(arg) { $.facebox({div:'#foo'}) } } ``` function fancyAlert ( arg ) { if ( arg ) { $ . facebox ({ div : '#foo' }) } } Text indented with a tab is formatted like this, and will also look like a code block in preview.

Obsidian supports linking to notes in Mermaid: ```mermaid graph TD Biology --> Chemistry class Biology,Chemistry internal-link; ``` An easier way to do it is the following: ^376b9d ```mermaid graph TD A[Biology] B[Chemistry] A --> B class A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z internal-link; ``` This way, all the note names (at least until Z[note name] ) are all automatically assigned the class internal-link when you use this snippet. If you use special characters in your note names, you need to put the note name in double quotes. \"\u2a33 special character\" It looks like this if you follow the second option : A[\"\u2a33 special character\"] Developer notes \u00b6 We strive for maximum capability without breaking any existing formats, therefore we use a slightly unorthodox combination of flavors of markdown.
